This repository contains all projects completed by Mayowa Olabode during the Advance Afica Scholarship Nanodegree funded by Access bank via Udacity.
The degree projects are centered on four real case studies highlighting four different organizations: Kaiser Permanente, Doordash, Amazon, and LinkedIn. 
These project submissions focuses on the Kaiser Permanente organization.
Case Description: Kaiser Permanente is looking to enter into the preventative care space to help their patient base increase physical activity and improve on healthy habits. While the overall goal is improved patient satisfaction and well being, the specific financial goal is reduced cost by emphasizing improved health prior to any adverse conditions developing. Overall, KP wants to decrease spending on conditions such as type 2 diabetes. Your team is tasked with researching the potential costs, features and benefits of a mobile application that communicates with KP patients and helps them improve on healthy habits.
